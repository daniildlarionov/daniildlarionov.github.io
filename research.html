            <p class="lead" align="justify">   I consider a repeated auction setting with colluding buyers and a seller who adjusts reserve prices over time without
		    long-term commitment. To model the seller's concern for collusion, I introduce a new equilibrium
		    concept: <i>collusive public perfect equilibrium</i>. For every strategy of the seller I define the corresponding 
		    <i>"buyer-game"</i> in which the seller is replaced by Nature who chooses the reserve prices for the buyers in accordance 
		    with the seller's strategy. A public perfect equilibrium is collusive if the buyers cannot achieve a higher symmetric public perfect equilibrium
		    payoff in the corresponding buyer-game.  In a setting with symmetric buyers with private binary <i>iid</i> valuations 
		    and publicly revealed bids, I find <i>collusive public perfect equilibria</i> that allow 
		    the seller to extract the entire surplus from the buyers  in the limit as the buyers' discount factor goes to 1. I therefore show that a non-committed seller can effectively 
		    fight collusion even when she faces patient buyers, can only set reserve prices, and has to satisfy stringent public disclosure requirements.  </p>

			<p class="lead" align="justify">   We study mechanism design with flexible but costly information acquisition. There is a principal and four or more agents,
				sharing a common prior over a set of payoff-relevant states. The principal proposes a mechanism to the agents who can then acquire information about the state by privately designing a signal device. 
				As long as it is costless for each agent to acquire a signal that is independent from the state, there exists a mechanism which 
				allows the principal to implement any social choice rule at zero information acquisition cost to the agents.  </p>
